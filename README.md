# Sovereign Technology · IP Licensing Portfolio

**SVTK** is a portfolio of production-ready cryptographic and infrastructure IP components built for air-gapped, zero-trust, and sovereign computing environments. Each component is designed to be sector-agnostic, composable, and deployable without cloud dependencies.

## Portfolio Overview

The IP is organized into four licensing bundles, each targeting a distinct infrastructure layer:

### Bundle A — Sovereign Custody
Cryptographic key management and secret recovery without hardware vendor lock-in. Includes Shamir 3-of-5 secret sharing, multi-signature rollover, Ed25519/AES-GCM identity, and offline-first sovereign key management.

### Bundle B — Compliance Audit
Append-only, tamperproof audit infrastructure for regulated environments. Includes Pulse Hash-Chain logging, replayable state machines, AES-256 sharding with IPFS, and capability token access control.

### Bundle C — Verifiable AI
Deterministic, auditable AI inference infrastructure. Includes the CGK deterministic kernel, Merkle proof output verification, counterfactual reasoning engine, and model provenance tracking.

### Bundle D — Sovereign Identity
Decentralized, offline-capable identity and access management. Includes DID-based identity chains, Ed25519 signing, ZK-derived capability tokens, and sovereign identity routing.
